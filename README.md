"Dragons" creates a character sheet for dungeons and dragons : race, name, height, weight, sex, class and statistics. 
There are a lot of comments if you want to change something : add a new class (only the basic four by now), new names ...etc. 
It is written for the RPG contest on Instructables and can be used by people who don't understand python 3 at all.
When you run this program it will create a . txt named "data" with your character sheet.
For now, it does not include spells, cantrips and arms but will soon.

ATTENTION : if you run this program multiple times, all the characters will appear on the same sheet !
